# Pekka Kana 2: AbdullahTrees's fork
This fork aims to...
* Port current [danilolc](https://github.com/danilolc/pk2)'s codebase to a Code::Blocks project file
* Which can then be compiled using `mingw-w64` on Windows to produce native Windows builds (NOT TESTED ON Linux/Mac)

In the far future...
* [FEATURE ADDITION] Add Statistics to track cool stats about gameplay and record them!
