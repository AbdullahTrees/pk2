Pekka Kana 2 (Pekka the Rooster 2) is a jump 'n run game made in the spirit of old classic platformers such as Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Jazz Jackrabbit, Super Frog and so on.

The simple goal in each level is to find the exit sign, which is usually not that simple as it sounds because of enemies, traps, and quirky puzzles.
